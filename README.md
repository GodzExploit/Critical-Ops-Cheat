# STATUS: ABANDONED

I put the code up here for anyone interested in seeing how to piece together a cheat for Unity games.  It was a rought draft for an ESP at the time, and would have progressed into something much cleaner, but the PC version of Critical Ops was shut down on July 10, 2017.



# Critical-Ops-Cheat
A cheat for the Unity game Critical Ops by Critical Force Entertainment

To directly try out the cheat, clone the repository and a compiled version can be accessed in the Build folder.



# How the it works / the folders are structured:
CheatInjector injects the MonoInvoke module, which in turn attaches to the mono thread to add the UnityGameObject, which is our cheat code.
