# STATUS: ABANDONED

I put the code up here for anyone interested in seeing how to piece together a cheat for Unity games.  It was a rought draft at the time, and would have progressed into something much cleaner, but the PC version of Critical Ops was shut down on July 10, 2017.

# Critical-Ops-Cheat
A cheat for the Unity game Critical Ops by Critical Force Entertainment

To directly try out the cheat, clone the repository and a execute-ready version can be accessed in the Build folder.



# How the it works / the folders are structured:
CheatInjector injects MonoInvoke, which ...

MonoInvoke attaches to the game and invokes the mono thread to add the ..

UnityGameObject, which is our cheat code.


# What's new
Nothing.  It's pretty trashy code right now because I haven't touched it since July.  I was planning on expanding and cleaning it up but news that the Critical Ops PC version was closing down caused me to abandon it for the sake of focusing on other projects ;)
